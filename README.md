# Explanation of React Code
- **Setting Up the SVG Canvas** â€“ Utilized `useRef` to reference the SVG element, and `d3.select` to initialize a 400x400 pixel canvas.  
- **Drawing the Cable Structure** â€“ A large black circle represents the outer boundary, with a smaller white circle and gray border acting as insulation.  
- **Adding Conductors** â€“ Four conductors are positioned inside the insulation, each with an outer black border and colored core (orange, blue, light pink).  
- **Enhancing with Details** â€“ Small brown strands inside each conductor represent wire bundles, complemented by gray ellipses for structure.  
- **Final Touches** â€“ Extra strands are added to the top-right for detailing, along with a small gray arc to complete the visualization.

# Explanation of Next.js Code
- **Reused React Component** â€“ Maintained modularity by integrating the previously created component for consistency.  
- **Set Up SVG Canvas** â€“ Used `useRef` and `d3.select` to initialize a 400x400 pixel canvas for dynamic rendering.  
- **Created Cable Structure** â€“ Designed outer insulation, conductors, and strands for accurate visualization using colors and shapes.  
- **Enhanced with Extra Details** â€“ Additional strands and a gray arc were added for improved realism and refinement.  
- **Implemented SSR as Props** â€“ Enabled server-side rendering (SSR) to dynamically pass cable structure data for better performance.

# Explanation of Vue.js Code
- **Reused Previously Created Vue Component** â€“ Ensured consistency and modularity by leveraging an existing component.  
- **Implemented SSR as Props** â€“ Added support for server-side rendering to dynamically pass necessary data.  
- **Created Cable Structure** â€“ Designed the outer insulation, conductors, and strands using D3.js for visualization.  
- **Added Extra Strands & Arc** â€“ Enhanced visual detailing and realism with additional structural elements.  
- **Used Ref & Lifecycle Hooks** â€“ Utilized `ref` and `onMounted` for dynamic SVG rendering.
